## Topic: How ambient factors affect student's performance
### STORY & IDEA 
Throughout our studying process at school, the grading system was always the main factor that was used to judge the students’ level, ability, or even their intelligence. But, does a student’s grade reflect their ability or intelligence. Well, we would say sometimes it does, but not most of the time.

The idea of our project is to point out that judging a student only by his/her grade is very wrong. By visualizing the data, we will show the relationship between student’s grade and their background factors - such as their family, parent, age, and many other factors. Hopefully, through our visualization, the audience can see a strong relationship between these ambient factors and the student’s performance at school.

The final purpose is to give a message that judging a student only by his/her grade is totally inaccurate. Since a student’s grade can be strongly affected by their background, situation, and many other ambient factors.
